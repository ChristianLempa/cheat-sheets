# Cloud Security Posture Management

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) assesses the cloud platform’s control plane to determine whether configurations are secure and compliant through tools that support compliance monitoring, integration with DevOps processes, incident response, risk assessment, and risk visualization.


## What does CSPM do?
	•	Supports compliance monitoring, integration with DevOps processes, incident response, risk assessment, and risk visualization.
	•	Identifies unknown or increased risk across an organization's cloud estate, including cloud services for compute, storage, identity, and access.
	•	Monitors defined policies to detect and address configuration issues that affect cloud environments.
	•	Tests the cloud environment for compliance and security violations.
	•	Delivers remediation steps automatically.
