# Cloud Workload Protection Platform

A Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) provides security protection for all types of workloads, including physical servers, virtual machines (VMs), containers, and serverless workloads, delivering a single view across on-premises and cloud environments.


## What does CWPP do?

	•	Provides workload-centric security protection solutions.
	•	Includes eight layers of control:
	•	Hardening, configuration, and vulnerability management
	•	Network firewalling, visibility, and micro segmentation
	•	System integrity assurance
	•	Application control and allow listing
	•	Exploit prevention and memory protection
	•	Server workload EDR, behavioral monitoring, and threat detection and response
	•	Host-based IPS with vulnerability shielding
	•	Anti-malware scanning
	•	Identifies vulnerabilities earlier in the CI/CD process.
	•	Detects exploits and active threats faster.
	•	Provides more context and investigative capabilities when responding to an incident.
	•	Maps observed activity to the MITRE ATT&CK enterprise matrix to help analysts and investigators understand incident severity by providing additional context.
