# Cloud Native Application Protection Platform

The Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (**CNAPP**) combines [[CWPP]] and [[CSPM]] capabilities to scan workloads and configurations in development and protect them at runtime. Securing cloud-native applications requires continuous processes that identify, assess, prioritize, and adapt to risk in cloud-native applications, infrastructures, and configurations.


## What does CNAPP do?
	•	Provides a systematic approach to identity and entity management.
	•	Adopts a zero trust security posture, including robust user identity management for developers and users.
	•	Delivers unified visibility to SecOps and DevOps teams.
	•	Enables teams to respond to threats, secure cloud-native apps, and automate vulnerability and misconfiguration remediation.
	•	Identifies and prioritizes all workloads, data, and infrastructure across endpoints, networks, and cloud based on risk.
	•	Protects organizations from configuration drift and supplies vulnerability assessments across VMs, containers, and serverless environments.
	•	Maps cloud-native threats to the MITRE ATT&CK enterprise and cloud matrices.
