# What is a Cloud Application?

A cloud application is a software program that runs in the cloud and is accessed remotely over the network.
It has all the functionality of a non cloud based application with the added advantage of being delivered over the network.

# Cloud Economics

Cloud computing reduces capital expenditures ( CapEx ) by eliminating the need to run and maintain your own infrastructure
Your costs shift to operating expenses ( OpEx ), which are generally lower as you only pay for the resources you consume

# Operational Efficiencies 

- Reduces Capital Expenses
- Reduces Staffing Costs
- Improves Productivity

# What is a Distributed System?

A distriuted computing system consists of multiple independent software components. These independent software components are located on different systems that communicate in such a way that they appear as a single system to  the end user

Note - Cloud computing is based on the  distributed systems model

### Types of Distributed Systems

![[Pasted image 20221018161824.png]]

1. Peer-to-Peer -> in the peer-to-peer architectural model, responsibilities are uniformly distributed among machines in the system.

2. Client-Server -> In the client-server model, data on the server is accessed by clients.

3. Three-tier -> The three-tier architectural model enables information about the client to be stored in the middle tier.

4. N-tier -> The n-tier architecture allows an application or server to forward requests to additional enterprise services on the network.

# Workloads

- The amount of work allocated to a defined computing task at any given time
- An isolated computing task that is executed indepenedently without any support from external programs or applications 

### Edge Computing :

- Is a distributed computing model that brings compute and storage workloads closer to the user
- Decreases latency and saves bandwidth
- Processes information close to the edge and decentralizes a network

### Workloads in distributed systems :

- Are distributed among the available IT resources based on the utilization of each resource
- Uses an algorithm that consumes runtime logic and distributes the workload among the available IT resouces evenly


# Bare Metal Server

- A physical server assigned to a single tenant 
- Can be modified based on  the  need for performance and security 
- Isolates resources from other tenants and provides security to your business
- Can be configured for  different cloud  setups
