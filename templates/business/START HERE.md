# About this system

Business is complex, there's a lot that can be customized and tweaked to work for your unique environment.

With the `Data View` plugin you can add your own custom `YAML` header information and query it. That alone is powerful.

Included in this template vault is a lot of my custom templates, my custom CSS, and some initial structure to get started for things like `#Training` `#Meeting`s tracking People, etc.

This system is incredibly flexible but does take some fine tuning to get setup well.

## Plugins

Some of the system relies on some 3rd party plugins

- Querying: 
	- `Dataview`
- Daily Notes:
	- `Periodic Notes`
	- `Calendar`
	- `Day Planner`
	- `Templater`
- and there are a myriad of other helpful plugins added that i think would be very helpful.
- Do update all the plugins when first opening the vault (**HIGHLY** recommended)

## The Office 365 Utilities

The `.vba` Utilities are meant for Outlook Only and are still very volatile but are being rigorously tested and have much more development left to be done one them.

See the `README.MD` in the Github Repo for how to begin utilizing them.

# Next Steps
