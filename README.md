# Cheat-Sheets for Tools and Technologies

These are my Cheat-Sheets I use for various projects, tools and technologies. They are separated in sections like [DevOps Tools](https://github.com/xcad2k/cheat-sheets/tree/main/devops), [Infrastructure](https://github.com/xcad2k/cheat-sheets/tree/main/infrastructure), [Cybersecurity](https://github.com/xcad2k/cheat-sheets/tree/main/cybersecurity), and much more.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my YouTube Channel: [The Digital Life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZNhwA1B5YqiY1nLzmM0ZRg).

### Warning

Please beware that products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.
