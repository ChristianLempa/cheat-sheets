# IPTables

Iptables is a user-space utility program that allows a system administrator to configure the IP packet filter rules of the **[Linux](linux.md)** kernel firewall, implemented as different Netfilter modules. The filters are organized in different tables, which contain chains of rules for how to treat network traffic packets. Different kernel modules and programs are currently used for different protocols; iptables applies to IPv4, ip6tables to IPv6, arptables to ARP, and ebtables to Ethernet frames.
