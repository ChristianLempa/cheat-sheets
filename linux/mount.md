# Mount

In **[Linux](linux.md)**, mount is a command in various operating systems. Before a user can access a file on a Unix-like machine, the file system on the device which contains the file needs to be mounted with the mount command. Frequently mount is used for SD card, USB storage, DVD and other removable storage devices.
