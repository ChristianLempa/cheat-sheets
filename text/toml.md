# TOML

TOML is a file format for configuration files. It is intended to be easy to read and write due to obvious semantics which aim to be "minimal", and is designed to map unambiguously to a dictionary. Its specification is open-source, and receives community contributions. TOML is used in a number of software projects, and is implemented in many programming languages. The name "TOML" is an acronym for "Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language" referring to its creator, Tom Preston-Werner.

This is a quick reference cheat sheet to the TOML format configuration file syntax.

## Introduction

[TOML](https://toml.io/en/) is a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics.

### Examples
```toml
bool = true
date = 2006-05-27T07:32:00Z
string = "hello"
number = 42
float = 3.14
scientificNotation = 1e+12
```

### Comments
```yaml
# A single line comment example

# block level comment example
# comment line 1
# comment line 2
# comment line 3
```

### Integer
```toml
int1 = +42
int2 = 0
int3 = -21
integerRange = 64
```

### Float
```toml
float2 = 3.1415
float4 = 5e+22
float7 = 6.626e-34
```

### Boolean
```toml
bool1 = true
bool2 = false
boolMustBeLowercase = true
```

### Datetime
```toml
date1 = 1989-05-27T07:32:00Z
date2 = 1989-05-26T15:32:00-07:00
date3 = 1989-05-27T07:32:00
date4 = 1989-05-27
time1 = 07:32:00
time2 = 00:32:00.999999
```

### String
```toml
str1 = "I'm a string."
str2 = "You can \"quote\" me."
str3 = "Name\tJos\u00E9\nLoc\tSF."
```
See: [Strings](#toml-strings)

### Table
```toml
[owner]
name = "Tom Preston-Werner"
dob = 1979-05-27T07:32:00-08:00
```
See: [Tables](#toml-tables)

### Array
```toml
array1 = [1, 2, 3]
array2 = ["Commas", "are", "delimiter"]
array3 = [8001, 8001, 8002]
```

### Friendly Array
```toml
array1 = [ "Don't mix", "different", "types" ]
array2 = [ [ 1.2, 2.4 ], ["all", 'strings', """are the same""", '''type'''] ]
array3 = [
  "Whitespace", "is", 
  "ignored"
]
```

## TOML Strings

### Multiline String
```toml
multiLineString = """
Multi-line basic strings are surrounded
by three quotation marks on each side
and allow newlines. 
"""
```

### Literal String
```toml
path = 'C:\Users\nodejs\templates'
path2 = '\\User\admin$\system32'
quoted = 'Tom "Dubs" Preston-Werner'
regex = '<\i\c*\s*>'
```
Surrounded by single quotes. Escaping are not allowed.

### MultiLine Literal String
```toml
re = '''\d{2} apps is t[wo]o many'''
lines = '''
The first newline is
trimmed in raw strings.
All other whitespace
is preserved.
'''
```

## TOML Tables
### Basic
```toml
[name]
foo = 1
bar = 2
```
`foo` and `bar` are keys in the table called `name`

### Nested
```toml
[table1]
	foo = "bar"

[table1.nested_table]
	baz = "bat"
```

### Array-like
```toml
[[comments]]
author = "Nate"
text = "Great Article!"

[[comments]]
author = "Anonymous"
text = "Love it!"
```
#### ↓ Equivalent JSON
```json
{
	"comments" : [
		{
			"author" : "Nate",
			"text" : "Great Article!"
		},
		{
			"author" : "Anonymous",
			"text" : "Love It!"
		}
	]
}
```

### Dot separated
```toml
[dog."tater.man"]
type = "pug"
```
#### ↓ Equivalent JSON
```json
{
  "dog": {
    "tater.man": {
      "type": "pug"
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-nested
```toml
[foo.bar.baz]
bat = "hi"
```
#### ↓ Equivalent JSON
```json
{
	"foo" : {
		"bar" : {
			"baz" : {
				"bat" : "hi"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Ignore whitespace
```toml
[a.b.c]          # this is best practice
[ d.e.f ]        # same as [d.e.f]
[ g .  h  .i ]   # same as [g.h.i]
[ j . "ʞ" .'l' ] # same as [j."ʞ".'l']
```

### Inline Table
```toml 
name = { first = "Tom", last = "Preston-Werner" }
point = { x = 1, y = 2 }
animal = { type.name = "pug" }
```
