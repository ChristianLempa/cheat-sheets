### Browser extension shortcuts

Some browsers, including Microsoft Edge and Safari may use the below key
combinations for other default shortcuts. In these cases, you will need to
configure your browsers shortcuts. For Chromium-based browsers (Chrome,
Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, and more) this can be done from
chrome://extensions/shortcuts, edge://extensions/shortcuts, and so on.
Instructions for configured browser extension shortcuts can be found at the
following links for Firefox and Safari users.

**[Note]** Autofill for Microsoft Edge requires the latest Chromium-based version.

* `Ctrl/CMD + Shift + Y` → Activate extension
* `Ctrl/CMD + Shift + L` → Auto-fill, press again to cycle through matching logins
* `Ctrl/CMD + Shift + 9` → Generate a password and copy it to the clipboard
* `Ctrl/CMD + Shift + N` → Lock extension

*Tip:* If a login uses the Bitwarden authenticator for TOTPs, using the `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + L` will automatically copy your TOTP to your clipboard after autofilling. All you have to do is `Cmd/Ctrl + V` to paste!
