# Contributor Guidelines

## Before you start

-   Post an issue on the [tracker](https://gitlab.com/ajak/tuir/issues)
    describing the bug or feature you would like to add
-   If an issue already exists, leave a comment to let others know that
    you intend to work on it

## Considerations

-   One of the project\'s goals is to maintain compatibility with as
    many terminal emulators as possible. Please be mindful of this when
    designing a new feature
    -   Is it compatible with both Linux and OS X?
    -   Is it compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3
    -   Will it work over ssh (without X11)?
    -   What about terminals that don\'t support color? Or in those with
        limited (8/256) colors?
    -   Will it work in tmux/screen?
    -   Will is fail gracefully if unicode is not supported?
-   If you\'re adding a new feature, try to include a few test cases.
    See the section below on setting up your test environment
-   If you tried, but you can\'t get the tests running in your
    environment, it\'s ok
-   If you are unsure about anything, ask!

## Submitting a pull request

-   Reference the issue \# that the pull request is related to
-   Make sure you have merged in the latest changes from the `master`
    branch
-   After you submit, make sure that the Travis-CI build passes
-   Be prepared to have your code reviewed. For non-trivial additions,
    it\'s normal for this process to take a few iterations

## Style guide

-   All code should follow [PEP
    8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

-   Try to keep lines under 80 characters, but don\'t sacrifice
    readability to do it!

    **Ugly**

    ``` python
    text = ''.join(
        line for line in fp2 if not line.startswith('#'))
    ```

    **Better**

    ``` python
    text = ''.join(line for line in fp2 if not line.startswith('#'))
    ```

-   Use the existing codebase as a reference when writing docstrings
    (adopted from the [Google Style
    Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Comments))

-   Add an encoding header `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to all new files

-   **Please don\'t submit pull requests for style-only code changes**

## Running the tests

This project uses [pytest](http://pytest.org/) and
[VCR.py](https://vcrpy.readthedocs.org/)

VCR is a tool that records HTTP requests made during the test run and
stores them in *tests/cassettes* for subsequent runs. This both speeds
up the tests and helps to maintain consistency across runs.

1.  Install the test dependencies

    ``` bash
    $ pip install tuir[test]
    ```

2.  Set your `$PYTHONPATH` to point to the directory of your TUIR
    repository.

    > ``` bash
    > $ export PYTHONPATH=~/code/tuir/
    > ```

3.  Run the tests using the existing cassettes

    ``` bash
    $ python -m pytest ~/code/tuir/tests/
    ================================ test session starts ================================
    platform linux -- Python 3.4.0, pytest-2.9.2, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.3.1
    rootdir: ~/code/tuir/, inifile:
    plugins: xdist-1.14, cov-2.2.0
    collected 113 items
    ```

4.  By default, the cassettes will act as read-only. If you have written
    a new test and would like to record a cassette, you must provide
    your own refresh token. The easiest thing to do is to use the token
    generated by TUIR when you log in. This is usually stored as
    *\~/.local/share/tuir/refresh-token*.

    ``` bash
    $ python -m pytest ~/code/tuir/tests/ --record-mode once --refresh-token ~/.local/share/tuir/refresh-token
    ================================ test session starts ================================
    platform linux -- Python 3.4.0, pytest-2.9.2, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.3.1
    rootdir: ~/code/tuir/, inifile:
    plugins: xdist-1.14, cov-2.2.0
    collected 113 items
    ```

    Note that all sensitive information will automatically be stripped
    from the cassette when it\'s saved.

5.  Once you have generated a new cassette, go ahead and commit it to
    your branch along with your test case
