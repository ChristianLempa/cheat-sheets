# SQLite Cheat-Sheet

SQLite is a relational database contained in a C library. In contrast to many other databases, SQLite is not a client-server database engine. Rather, it's embedded into an end program.

SQLite generally follows the [PostgreSQL](databases/postgres.md) syntax but does not enforce type checking.

You can open a SQLite Database with `sqlite3 <filename>` directly.
