----

> Oh My Zsh can sometimes get a bit in the way, and it needs more polish, but generally it turns zsh from something which takes a lot of research and config fiddling into something that works pleasantly out of the box, and makes tweaking more straightforward

> This project is so much more than a sane set of defaults for zsh. It is a major hub of plugin development! The fact that everything is all nicely packaged as a project on github is very nice indeed. Zsh is an amazing shell, but it seems to suffer a lack of guides on how to use it. By checking out Oh My Zsh you get a really nice set of examples in which you can learn zsh

> My mouth dropped the first time I saw my new terminal with Oh My Zsh. I teach web development to students at a bootcamp. When students are struggling with the terminal, I tell them to install Oh My Zsh and struggling students start understanding it better. Its amazing themes can tell the students what directory they are in right way and what branch too
