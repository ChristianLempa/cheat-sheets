# External plugins

## A list of plugins that don't come bundled with Oh My Zsh

There is no restriction for adding your plugin into zsh bundle (unlike [themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes)) but the rationale for creating this page is next:

* sometimes you're not really sure if your plugin will not harm (e.g. it can break something).

### Installation

It should be clear from [this](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-and-adding-plugins).

### The plugins

#### Custom git plugin

Fixes some inconsistencies in the default git plugin that make the aliases more intuitive, while adding some other useful functions.

You can get it from [here](https://github.com/davidde/git).

#### Git auto status

If you found yourself constantly typing `git status` after bunch of commands like
`git commit` and you want to avoid that, then this plugin is for you.

This plugin is a nice addition to **git_prompt_status**.

You can get it from [here](https://gist.github.com/oshybystyi/475ee7768efc03727f21).

#### History Sync

GPG encrypted, Internet synchronized Zsh history using Git.

You can get it from [here](https://github.com/wulfgarpro/history-sync).

#### Doge Say
