# Welcome to Oh My Zsh!

Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

- You'll need `zsh` to install **Oh My Zsh**. Run `zsh --version` to check if you have it:

  ```console
  $ zsh --version
  zsh 5.8 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)
  ```

- If you see `command not found` you don't have zsh installed. See [Installing Zsh](Installing-ZSH.md) for instructions.
- Once you have zsh, you can install Oh My Zsh by simply running one of these commands:

  | Method    | Command                                                                                           |

  | **fetch** | `sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` |
