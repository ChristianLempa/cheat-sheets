# Troubleshooting

This page is meant to describe the most common problems with Oh My Zsh and what you can do to diagnose them:

## Keyboard shortcut problems

Example:

```sh
bindkey '^L' clear-screen
```

Two main things could go wrong:

1. The key sequence (`^L` in the example) does not match the key sequence being sent to the terminal:  

   You can see the exact sequence a keyboard shortcut sends by pressing `CTRL`+`V` and then the keyboard shortcut.
   For example: `CTRL`+`V`, `CTRL`+`L` will output `^L` (`^` represents the Control key).

2. The command executed (`clear-screen` in the example) has an error. In that case, post both the key binding and
    the definition of the command (if exists) like so:

   - **key binding:** `bindkey '^[[1;6D'`  
     will print `"^[[1;6D" insert-cycledleft`
   - **command definition:** `which insert-cycledleft`  
     will print `insert-cycledleft () { ... }`
  
     Notice that sometimes the command is a builtin [zle widget](https://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html) and so the `which` command won't work. If that's the case, just post the key binding and we'll figure it out.

## Completion problems

Many completion problems, including the infamous `command not found: compdef`, can be solved by resetting the completion system.

1. First, try to remove your completion cache with `rm ~/.zcompdump*`, close and reopen your shells.

2. If you still have problems, try fully resetting the completion system, as explained by
    [**@dragon788**](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/630#issuecomment-70291622):

   ```zsh
   compaudit | xargs chmod g-w,o-w
   compaudit | xargs chown "$USER"
   rm ~/.zcompdump*
   exec zsh
   ```

3. If nothing helps you might have encountered a bug within a particular command's completion. Open a new issue documenting the issue, and if possible provide a trace of the completion function. You can do that by writing the command you want to complete, then pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> followed by <kbd>?</kbd>.

## Other problems

As a last resort, if you're getting weird behavior and can't find the culprit, run the following command to enable debug mode:

```sh
zsh -xv 2> >(tee ~/omz-debug.log &>/dev/null)
```

Afterwards, reproduce the behavior (_i.e._ if it's a particular command, run it), and when you're done, run `exit` to stop the debugging session. This will create a `omz-debug.log` file on your home directory, with a trace of every command executed and its output. You can then upload this file when creating an issue.

If you only need to debug the session initialization, you can do so with the command:

```sh
zsh -xvic exit &> ~/omz-debug.log
```
