# Volunteers

Oh My Zsh has had contributions from 2,000+ developers across the planet, which is truly amazing and something we're proud of. Yet, there has only been a small handful of developers who have played a big role in organizing, prioritizing, triaging, promoting, and maintaining all these contributions.

As we look ahead to the next few years, we are seeking more volunteers to play different roles.

Interested to learn more?

Given that we know there is a wide range of ways that people could get involved, we have decided to experiment with outlining a framework for how you can get started. Like all open source, this is a Work in Progress (WIP) and we'll be iterating on it as we have questions/feedback pop up.
