## If you want to learn more about Zsh

- [**Zsh Home**](https://zsh.sourceforge.io): contains links to many different Zsh resources.

- [**FAQ**](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/FAQ): the Zsh project also has an FAQ.

- [**Guide**](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/zshguide.html): an overview of Zsh for beginners. Kind of like a Getting started guide.

- [**Docs**](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/zsh_toc.html): this contains more advanced information about Zsh.

- [**Zsh Mailing List**](https://zsh.org/mla): the project has a mailing list where most of the stuff happens.

  **The `zsh-users` list is for asking questions as a user; the `zsh-workers` list is for asking questions as a
  developer of Zsh code**.
  
  I recommend joining the `zsh-workers` list and periodically reading the emails to push your knowledge further,
  even if sometimes you don't understand what you're reading. You can also use it to search if your question
  has already been answered by adding `site:https://zsh.org/mla` to your Google search.

- [**IRC**](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Arc/irc.html): even though most of the stuff happens in the mailing list,
  you can try asking questions in IRC if you need immediate feedback. You can also use the #zsh channel of this server.

- **`man` pages and `info`**: you can browse the Zsh man pages (`man zsh`) or the `info zsh` guide. These are
  equivalent to searching the Docs website, but you might be more comfortable doing it from the command line.

- The [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#troubleshooting) section of the [powerlevel10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)'s
  README has a lot of useful trivia about Zsh and terminals in general. The whole README is very useful, so even if it
  doesn't apply to what you're looking for, you'll probably learn a lot.
