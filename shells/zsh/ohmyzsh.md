## Commands

| Command         | Description                                                                                |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alias`         | List all aliases                                                                           |
| `mkcd` | Create a new directory and change to it, will create intermediate directories as required. |
| `take` | Like `mkcd`, but also knows how to handle remote URLs. When given an argument that looks like a URL (something that ends in `.git` or `.tar.(gz\|bz2\|xz)`), download the remote resource and extract it (if necessary) into the current directory. Then change to the newly extracted/downloaded/cloned directory. |
| `zsh_stats`     | Get a list of the top 20 commands and how many times they have been run.                   |
