# Autonegotiation

**Autonegotiation** is a feature in Ethernet networking that allows two connected devices to automatically negotiate and establish the best possible parameters for communication. When two devices with **autonegotiation** capability are connected, they exchange information about their supported capabilities, such as link speed (e.g., 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps), duplex mode (e.g., half-duplex or full-duplex), and flow control.

Based on this information, the devices negotiate and agree upon the highest mutually supported settings for optimal communication.

**Autonegotiation** helps ensure compatibility and optimal performance between network devices. It eliminates the need for manual configuration and allows network devices to adapt to different speeds and duplex modes based on the capabilities of the connected devices.
