# ncmpcpp â€“ featureful NCurses based MPD client

[![License: GPL v2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL_v2-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)

An mpd client (compatible with mopidy) with a UI very similar to ncmpc, but it provides new useful features such as support for regular expressions for library searches, extended song format, items filtering, the ability to sort playlists, and a local filesystem browser.

The [mpcplus](mpcplus.md) fork of ***ncmpcpp*** is used by [MusicPlayerPlus](../projects/MusicPlayerPlus.md) as the default MPD client.

## configure ncmpcpp

```shell
mkdir ~/.ncmpcpp
cat <<EOF > ~/.ncmpcpp/config
ncmpcpp_directory =         "~/.ncmpcpp"
mpd_host =                  "127.0.0.1"
mpd_port =                  "6600"
mpd_music_dir =             "/var/lib/mpd/music/"
EOF
```
